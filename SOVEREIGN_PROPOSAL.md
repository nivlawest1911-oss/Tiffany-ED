**TO:** Mobile County Public Schools Purchasing & Special Education Leadership

**VENDOR ID:** [STAARS_ID_HERE]

## **I. Executive Summary**
In response to the unprecedented administrative burden of the **Alabama Literacy Act** and the **Alabama Numeracy Act**, **EdIntel Sovereign** provides a high-fidelity intelligence layer designed to return instructional capacity to the classroom. This is a locally-engineered, doctoral-grade solution tailored specifically for the **Team MCPSS** environment.

## **II. The Sovereign Advantage**
Unlike generalized AI tools, EdIntel is built on a **Zero-Trust Sovereign Node** architecture:
*   **Data Sovereignty:** Student data is encrypted and isolated. It is never used to train public models.
*   **PowerSchool Bridge:** Automated roster synchronization via OneRoster API removes all manual data entry friction.
*   **Fiduciary Integrity:** Developed by a DBA in Analytic Finance, every feature is calibrated for measurable ROI.

## **III. Scaling Protocol (100-Day Roadmap)**
| Phase | Scope | Institutional Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. Pilot (14 Days)** | 3 Target Sites | Zero-cost evaluation of data sovereignty & accuracy. |
| **II. Integration** | Cluster Level | Site-wide PLUs and certified narrative protocols. |
| **III. District MSA** | 50+ Sites | Enterprise-grade oversight & centralized energy vault. |

## **IV. Financial Model**
*   **Standard Site License:** $79.00 / month
*   **Initial Reserve:** 10,000 Liquid Energy Units (Provisioned)
*   **Labor Reclaimed:** Est. 15+ hours per teacher / month

## **V. Compliance Certification**
This system is strictly aligned with **FERPA/SOPPA** guidelines and current **ALSDE** proficiency benchmarks. As a retired MCPSS educator and doctoral researcher, I personally certify the pedagogical rigor of this infrastructure.
