# EdIntel Sovereign Ecosystem: Project Plan

## I. Project Vision

**EdIntel & The Transcend Ecosystem** — A unified platform for Intelligence, Compliance, and Holistic Wellness.
We are building a "Digital Prefrontal Cortex" for Special Education Directors, Administrators, and Teachers.

## II. The 12 Feature Branches (The Nodes)

| Node | Branch | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Intelligence** | `feature/ai-hub` | Sovereign AI Chat, specialized system prompts, token efficiency. |
| **2. Compliance** | `feature/sovereign-vault` | IEP storage, OCR auditing, "Sentinel Auditor" compliance engine. |
| **3. Leadership** | `feature/admin-command` | ROI tracking, "Sovereign Ledger," Executive Roleplay, Suspension Alternatives. |
| **4. Metacognition** | `feature/cognitive-gym` | Student logic sprints, "Arena of Logic," point tracking. |
| **5. Cultural Media** | `feature/studio-griot` | "Netflix-style" gallery for curated instructional & cultural video. |
| **6. Wellness** | `feature/transcend-wellness` | Teacher "Burnout Shield," cognitive load tracking, holistic resets. |
| **7. Finance** | `feature/ledger-billing` | Medicaid capture, "Instructional Days Saved" ROI calculator. |
| **8. Logistics** | `feature/roster-logistics` | Caseload management, "Timeline Sentinel" (due date logic). |
| **9. Training** | `feature/academy-training` | Staff PD, certification tracking, "Executive Logic Aggregator." |
| **10. Publishing** | `feature/transcend-editing` | Academic manuscript review and publishing workflow. |

## III. Architectural Moat

* **Stack**: Next.js 15 (App Router), Prisma, Supabase, Tailwind CSS.
* **Rule**:
  * **Base UI**: `src/components/ui/` (Immutable, pure presentation).
  * **Features**: `src/components/features/` (Business logic, stateful assembly).
* **Security**: "Sovereign Gatekeeper" via `useAccess` hook and Tier-based permissions.
* **Performance Moat**:
  * **Global Distribution**: Edge Runtime for mission-critical transformations.
  * **Intelligent Revalidation**: Tag-based revalidation for high-fidelity data sync.
  * **Streaming Architecture**: Partial Prerendering (PPR) for instant app-shell delivery.

## IV. Current Priority

**Initializing The Nodes**: Establishing the git branches and scaffolding the core logic for the "Roster" and "Admin Command" nodes.
