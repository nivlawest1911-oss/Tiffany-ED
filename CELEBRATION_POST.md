**Headline:** Modernizing the Alabama Classroom: The EdIntel Sovereign Pilot Authorized.

**Post Content:**
Today, the Mobile County Board of School Commissioners took a definitive step toward returning capacity to our educators. I am honored to announce that **EdIntel Sovereign** has been authorized for deployment across three pilot sites within **MCPSS**.

As a retired educator and DBA, I know that 'more tech' isn't always the answer—**smarter infrastructure** is. By automating complex IEP narratives and aligning with the Alabama Literacy Act in real-time, we are restoring the most valuable resource in our schools: **Instructional Time**.

To my colleagues in leadership: We are no longer just managing data; we are architecting **Educational Sovereignty**.

Let’s begin the work.
