## 📸 Visual Strategy (The "Scroll Stopper")

**Do not just post a text link.** You must attach high-value imagery.
*   **Option A (The Sovereign Tech):** Attach the new **IEP Interface** image (`nav_sovereign_iep_interface.png`) to show raw power.
*   **Option B (The Founder's Promise):** Attach the **Dr. West Portrait** (`dr_alvin_west.png`) to build trust/authority.
*   **Option C (The Carousel):** Upload 3-4 images (IEP Interface, Lesson Planner, FERPA Shield) to create a swipeable gallery.

## 📝 Post Option 1: The "Visionary Leader" (Best for Personal Brand)
*Ideal for Dr. West's personal page or LinkedIn.*

**Headline:** It’s time to take our time back. ⏳✊🏾

**Body:**
For too long, I’ve watched brilliant educators explicitly burnt out by paperwork that has nothing to do with teaching. We spend hours on compliance, leaving minutes for connection.

Today, I’m changing that equation.

Introducing **EdIntel Sovereign**. 🛡️🧠

This isn't just another "AI tool." This is a sovereign intelligence node built specifically for Alabama educators. We are talking about:
✅ **IEP Goals** written in seconds, not hours.
✅ **Grant Proposals** drafted with executive precision.
✅ **Lesson Plans** that actually align with our standards.
✅ **FERPA Compliant.** Secure. Private.

I built this because we deserve tools that respect our expertise.

The system is live. The protocol is ready.
Claim your sovereignty today. 👇

## 🛡️ Post Option 2: The "Compliance & Security" (Best for District Groups)
*Ideal for posting in "Alabama Teachers" or "Principal" groups.*

**Headline:** 🔒 Finally. AI that is actually FERPA Compliant.

**Body:**
We all know AI can help save time, but the privacy risks have scared districts away. Until now.

**EdIntel Sovereign** is live today.

It is the first platform engineered with a strict **"School Official" exception architecture**.
🛡️ **Zero-Training Policy:** Your student data is NEVER used to train public models.
🛡️ **Audit Logs:** Every action is secure and traceable.
🛡️ **Specialized Agents:** Specialized tools for IEPs, Behavior Plans, and Data Analysis.

Don't settle for generic tools that put your license at risk. Use the platform built by Dr. Alvin West specifically for our compliance needs.

## ⚡ Post Option 3: The "Magic Moment" (Short & Punchy)
*Best for Instagram or quick updates.*

**Body:**
Imagine finishing your entire week's lesson planning in 15 minutes. 🤯

It’s not magic. It’s **EdIntel Sovereign**.

We just went live with the new **IEP Architect** and **Grant Writer** modules. The feedback from early testers in Alabama has been incredible.

Stop taking work home this weekend. Let the Sovereign AI handle the heavy lifting.
